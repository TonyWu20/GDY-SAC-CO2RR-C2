# CO2RR C3 pathway key intermediate(s)

Key points:

1. C3 products might be generated from coupling of C2 and C1 intermediates, which competes against the protonation of C2 and C1 products (the subsequent steps of C2 and C1 pathway) (J. Phys. Chem. C 2022, 126, 12, 5502–5512)
2. H2CCO/H3CCO + CO -> H2CCOCO/H3CCOCO (J. Phys. Chem. C 2022, 126, 12, 5502–5512)
3. H2CCOCO shows a more significant charge separation than HCCHOCO, H3CCOCO, and H2CCHOCO under the Bader charge analysis, which means that H2CCOCO can be stabilized by surface with proper electronic structures. (J. Phys. Chem. C 2022, 126, 12, 5502–5512)
4. COCH3 -> COCOCH3 for C3 pathway producing CH3COCH3 acetone. (Nature Communications volume 11, Article number: 2455 (2020))
5. COCOH can lead to C2 and C3 products at high pH. The pH change will lead to kinetical block of C1 pathway or C2/C3 pathway. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016, 138, 2, 483–486)
6. CHOCOCHOH is the branch intermediates for two groups of C3 products. (Preprint from Research Square, 21 Sep 2020
   DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-66715/v1. Sargent's group's work) ![pathway](./C3_path1.jpg
7. 3 CO -> OCCOCO (J. Mater. Chem. A, 2022,10, 5998-6006 )
8. Try numerous C2 intermediates coupling with CO\*to form C3 intermediate. HCCH\* and/or CH3CHO\* intermediates have the most favorable kinetics to form a C3 intermediate depending on the surface structure. (J. Phys. Chem. C 2021, 125, 48, 26437–26447)

Cu is the popular element choice.
